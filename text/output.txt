00:00:  A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts. 00:09:  So he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions. 00:18:  By thoughts I mean specifically, chatter in the skull, perpetual and compulsive repetition 00:25:  of words, of reckoning and calculating. 00:32:  I'm not saying that thinking is bad. 00:36:  Like everything else is useful in moderation. 00:40:  A good servant but a bad master. 00:43:  And all so-called civilized peoples have increasingly become crazy and self-destructive 00:50:  because through excessive thinking they have lost touch with reality. 00:56:  That's to say, we confuse signs, words, numbers, symbols and ideas with the real world. 01:07:  Most of us would have rather money than tangible wealth. 01:13:  And a great occasion is somehow spoiled for us unless photographed. 01:19:  And to read about it the next day in the newspaper is oddly more fun for us than the original event. 01:30:  This is a disaster. 01:34:  For as a result of confusing the real world of nature with mere signs, such as bank balances 01:41:  and contracts, we are destroying nature. 01:47:  We are so tied up in our minds that we've lost our senses. 01:53:  Time to wake up. 01:57:  What is reality? 02:00:  Obviously no one can say because it isn't words. 02:05:  It isn't material. That's just an idea. 02:09:  It isn't spiritual. That's also an idea, a symbol. 02:17:  Reality is this.
